# Gen 6 CTRPluginFramework

Gen 6 CTRPluginFramework is a 3gx plugin for Pokemon X, Y, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire on the Nintendo 3DS console. This plugin is based off of [Alolan CTRPluginFramework](https://github.com/biometrix76/alolanctrpluginframework/releases/latest), with PKHeX implementations in an updated `.3gx` file format. This project is a continuation of the previously abandoned [project](https://github.com/semaj14/Multi-PokemonFramework) due to lost accesses.
